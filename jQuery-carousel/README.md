# Phase I:

* **When clicking the right arrow:** the current image should slide out to the left, and the next image should slide in from the right
* **When clicking the left arrow:** the current image should slide out to the right, and the previous image should slide in from the left
* When I reach the end of the slide show, hide the right arrow
* When I reach the beginning of the slide show, hide the left arrow
* Try using only CSS3 for the slide animation; use jQuery for the click handling and current slide detection

### Phase II:

* Images should slide in an infinite loop
* Images should automatically slide every 5 seconds
* The 5-second timer should be reset every time a new image is displayed

Here are some conveniently-sized images for you to use:
